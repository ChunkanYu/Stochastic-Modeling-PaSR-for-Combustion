# Stochastic Modeling of Partially Stirred Reactor (PaSR)
The _PaSR4Comb_ code is used to Turbulence-Chemistry Interaction for combustion system. 


## Numerical Implementation
### Through-flow

### Molecular mixing process 
+ IEM
+ MCM
+ MMC

> [!NOTE]
> The MMC mixing model will be updated soon.The block for MMC is still not be tested intensively.

### Chemical reaction process

```math
\frac{\text{d}\phi}{\text{d}t}=\mathcal{R}(\phi),
```
